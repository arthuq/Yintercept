# Yintercept

Hello, Thank you for your time.
Here is the projet repository.
I have done three strategies:
- VWAP
- Lasso regression on other assets
- LAsso regression on VWAPs.

I had other ideas, but I don't think I'll be able to code them with the time left.
Ideas inclue :
- technical analysis automation (I already did a project on this so I preferred to do something new here)
- machine learning for prediction (XGBoost for example)
- implement shorting mecanism to trade bearish market without holding asset
- Use a forgetting factor to favor present data in learning dataset (regression models)


Best regards, 
Arhur MARON
